	abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of ﬁsh assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can ﬂexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate ﬁshery management quantities such as ﬁshing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model conﬁgurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efﬁciently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

	abstract = {Models of stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs) are often used to predict fish population dynamics. Commonly used SRRs include the Ricker, Beverton-Holt, and Cushing functional forms, which differ primarily by the degree of density-dependent effects (compensation). The degree of compensation determines whether recruitment respectively decreases, saturates, or increases at high levels of spawning stock biomass. In 1982, J.G. Shepherd united these dynamics into a single model, where the degree of compensation is determined by a single parameter. However, the difficulty in relating this parameter to biological data has limited its usefulness. Here, we use a generalized modeling framework to show that the degree of compensation can be related directly to the functional elasticity of growth, which is a general quantity that measures the change in recruitment relative to a change in biomass. We show that the elasticity of growth can be calculated from perturbations in fish biomass, is robust to observation error, and can be used to determine general attributes of the SRR in both continuous time production models, as well as discrete time age-structured models.},

            Biological regulatory systems, such as cell signaling networks, nervous systems and ecological webs, consist of complex dynamical interactions among many components. Network motif models focus on small sub-networks to provide quantitative insight into overall behavior. However, such models often overlook time delays either inherent to biological processes or associated with multi-step interactions. Here we systematically examine explicit-delay versions of the most common network motifs via delay differential equation (DDE) models, both analytically and numerically. We find many broadly applicable results, including parameter reduction versus canonical ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, analytical relations for converting between ODE and DDE models, criteria for when delays may be ignored, a complete phase space for autoregulation, universal behaviors of feedforward loops, a unified Hill-function logic framework, and conditions for oscillations and chaos. We conclude that explicit-delay modeling simplifies the phenomenology of many biological networks and may aid in discovering new functional motifs.},

We investigated the effect of incorporating unequal recruitment and mortality time lags into depletion-based stock reduction analysis (DB-SRA), a stock assessment method for data-poor species. Using both simulated data and catch series of Pacific rockfish (Sebastes spp.), we found that for declining stocks with no mortality delay and a recruitment time lag equal to age-at-maturity, estimated overfishing limits were up to 40\% lower than those from the model with both time lags equal to age-at-maturity. Deviation between the two models’ predictions increases with age-at-maturity and natural mortality rate, suggesting that time lag separation is most important for long-lived species. We propose a correction factor for net production models that eliminates stock overestimation due to implicitly equal time lags.},

              We present a novel adaptation of the classic discrete delay‐difference model, a continuous delay‐differential model (cDDM), which can adequately represent population dynamics of stocks that turn over rapidly and continuously over time (e.g., small pelagic fish, small tunas, and shrimps). We used the Northern‐Central Peruvian anchoveta stock (
              Engraulis ringens
              , Engraulidae) as a case study for implementing the cDDM and conducted a management strategy evaluation (MSE) through stochastic optimization in policy space (SOPS). Our results showed that cDDM integrated with SOPS efficiently searches optimum and near‐optimum harvest control rules (HCR) and is an alternative to pre‐setting arbitrary HCRs as in traditional MSE. The cDDM showed comparable stock biomass and recruitment estimate reconstructions to more complex stock assessment models described for anchoveta. We concluded that the anchoveta stock is sustainably managed and is an example of adaptive fisheries management under high ocean‐climate variability and uncertainty. Contrary to fishery textbooks, the anchoveta's collapse was not entirely due to the 1972 El Niño (EN) but a recruitment failure preceding EN. Our reconstructions revealed that low recruitment (or recruitment failure) could still occur at high stock biomass. Anchoveta's stock biomass is larger than pre‐collapse, likely due to favourable environmental conditions (a cooling trend) and management, despite more frequent and stronger EN events. SOPS quickly revealed that harvest strategies with large base biomass ({\textgreater}5 mmt) lead to higher interannual stock variability and would not produce substantial increases in long‐term yield. Alternative HCRs with lower base biomass, while adjusting for productivity regimes, have similar long‐term yields without affecting the long‐term average stock.},

	abstract = {Most exploited aquatic populations lack the fishery selectivity and life-history information, by age/size, needed to develop harvest control rules (HCRs). This study relies on stage-structured life-history and fishery characteristics inherent in delay-difference models to set out a typology of composite (age-aggregated) yield per-recruit (CYPR) models along with composite spawning stock per-recruit (CSSR) models and composite spawning per-recruits (CSPRs) and propose the related, conventional-like biological reference points, which may prove useful in devising HCRs, especially for data-poor stocks. CYPR, CSSR, and CSPR are equilibrium and interrelated metrics controlled by fishing mortality. Inputs to their development include growth and natural mortality parameters and, eventually, stage-specific selectivity, natural mortality, and maturity. In spite of numerous formulations of CYPRs denoted CYPR1 to CYPR15, CYPRs fall into three types of equations following from the Leslie–DeLury depletion model family for open populations (prototype: CYPR3), the Deriso–Schnute delay-difference model family (prototype: CYPR9), and some differential forms of the previous two model families (prototype: CYPR14). CYPR3, CYPR9, and CYPR14 exhibit, respectively, patterns increasing monotonically toward asymptotes and dome-shaped patterns which, beyond their maxima, trend toward the mean weight-at-recruitment and zero. Comparisons of fishing mortality-based biological reference points (FBRPs) from CYPRs and CSPRs with the fishing mortality producing the maximum sustainable yield (FMSY) or FMSY proxies from 53 data-rich stock assessments on the US East Coast indicate that some FBRPs are accurate estimators of FMSY or FMSY proxies. CYPR14 is the recommended CYPR for determining the plausible sustainability status of data-poor stocks because it accommodates more growth parameters, maximizes at a fishing mortality rate that qualifies for FMSY and has the greatest accuracy about FMSY for the majority of data-rich stocks. Composite per-recruit models should be used in stage-structured model assessments in the same way that conventional per-recruit models are used in age- and length-structured model assessments.},

Analytical reference points for age-structured models: application to data-poor fisheries. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 165–175.Analytical solutions for biological reference points are derived in terms of maximum lifetime reproductive rate. This rate can be calculated directly from biological parameters of maturity, fecundity, and natural mortality or a distribution for this rate can be derived from appropriate metadata. Minimal data needs and assumptions for determining stock status are discussed. The derivations lead to a re-parameterization of the common stock–recruit relationships, Beverton–Holt and Ricker, in terms of spawning potential ratio. Often, parameters in stock–recruit relationships are restricted by tight prior distributions or are fixed based on a hypothesized level of stock resilience. Fixing those parameters is equivalent to specifying the biological reference points. An ability to directly calculate reference points from biological data, or a meta-analysis, without need of a full assessment model or fisheries data, makes the method an attractive option for data-poor fisheries. The derivations reveal an explicit link between the biological characteristics of a species and appropriate management. Predicted stock status for a suite of shark species was compared with recent stock assessment results, and the method successfully identified whether each stock was overfished.},

	abstract = {Limited data, and the requirement to provide science-based advice for exploited populations, have led to the development of statistical methods that combine several sources of information into a single analysis. This approach, “integrated analysis”, was first formulated by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Contemporary use of integrated analysis involves using all available data, in as raw a form as appropriate, in a single analysis. Analyses that were traditionally carried out independently are now conducted simultaneously through likelihood functions that include multiple data sources. For example, the traditional analysis of converting catch-at-length data into catch-at-age data for use in an age-structured population dynamics models can be avoided by including the basic data used in this conversion, length-frequency and conditional age-at-length data, in the likelihood function. This allows for consistency in assumptions and permits the uncertainty associated with both data sources to be propagated to final model outputs, such as catch limits under harvest control rules. The development of the AD Model Builder software has greatly facilitated the use of integrated analyses, and there are now several general stock assessment models (e.g., Stock Synthesis) that allow many data types and model assumptions to be analyzed simultaneously. In this paper, we define integrated analysis, describe its history and development, give several examples, and describe the advantages of and problems with integrated analysis.},
