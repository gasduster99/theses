\begin{abstract}
Stock assessments often assume a two-parameter functional form
(e.g. Beverton-Holt, Ricker, or Logistic) for the expected recruitment produced by a
given level of spawning output. Mangel et. al. \cite{mangel_perspective_2013} %Mangel et al. (2013) 
and others have shown that biological reference points (RP) such as $\frac{F^*}{M}$
and $\frac{B^*}{\bar{B}(0)}$ are largely determined by a single parameter
(steepness) when using two-parameter relationships. These functions introduce
strong correlations between RPs that are pre-determined by the functional form, 
rather than a biological characteristic of the stock. Mangel et. al. note that 
use of a three-parameter stock-recruitment relationship allows for independent 
estimation of these RPs.

%
Modern fisheries management is a multi-armed system based upon stock assessment. 
Stock assessments characterize stock dynamics by collecting the available 
data for a particular stock and analyzing those data with population dynamics 
models. Population dynamics models are then used to quantify the effect of 
fishing on the stock and estimate long term sustainable catch levels which are 
then used by fisheries managers. 

% bracket maximum catch limits
In the United States the Magnuson-Stevens Act\footnote{Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 2007. Pub. L. No. 94-265.} (MSA)
dictates that stock assessment be a primarily scientific endeavor, and requires 
%it holds to the standard of
stock assessment to report \textit{the best available science} 
to fisheries managers. Furthermore, the MSA requires fisheries managers %to the standard of 
to base management decisions upon the best available science. 
There are a number of checks and balances between the scientific and management 
arms, but ultimately it is fisheries managers that set the actual catch limits 
(based on science developed by stock assessments) that govern the amount of fish 
that can be harvested. This system has proven to be effective, but it can %a globally emulated system 
create an information bottleneck at the interface of stock assessment and 
management. 

%and the MSA dictates that fisheries managers base cath limits upon the science developed by stock assessments. 
%This philosophical devision of 
%power has numerous extemely important benefits, ranging from the inclusion of 
%diverse views from varied stakeholders, focusing specialized knowledge, 
%and creating a science-based environment to evaluated data.

%%\textit{set the context for my question}
%The most fundamental model in modern fisheries management is the surplus-production
%model (SPM). These models focus on modeling population growth via nonlinear
%parametric ordinary differential equations (ODE). Key management quantities
%called reference points (RPs) are commonly derived from the ODE's equilibrium
%equations and depend upon the parameterization of biomass production.
%Two-parameter forms of the production function have been shown to
%limit the theoretical domain of RPs \cite{mangel_perspective_2013}.
%The limited RP-space of two-parameter models makes these models vulnerable to
%model misspecification with respect to RPs, and thus the limiting stucture of
%two-parameter models may in and of itself induce bias in RP estimation using
%these models. The behavior of RP estimation is not well understood and as a
%result patterns of bias in RP estimation may easily go unnoticed. A
%metamodeling approach is developed here to describe RP biases and explore
%mechanisms of model failure under the most common two-parameter models. %in the Schaefer model.
%}

%
While stock assessment scientists do their best to bracket models with 
uncertainty, and contextualize results, inevitably not all of the modeling 
subtlety understood by scientists makes it into the management arm. Fisheries 
are very often managed based upon reference points (RPs) which serve as 
simplified heuristic measures of population behavior, and subtlety in how 
these measures are calculated can get lost in the transfer. %be lost in these measures. 
Mangel et. al. \cite{mangel_perspective_2013} and others have shown that RPs can 
be structurally limited by the most commonly used assessment models. When 
these limitations are propagated to management these limitations can directly 
bias how catch limits for fisheries are set. The nature of these limitations 
manifests from the assumed mathematical form of production which is among the 
most foundational components of most population dynamics models.

%fisheries management
The most fundamental model in stock assessment is the {\it surplus-production
model} (SPM). These models focus on modeling population growth via nonlinear
parametric ordinary differential equations (ODE).
%NOTE: we can not observe all fish in the sea, and this rely on an index of abundance 
%which typically comes from experimental fishing procedure(for example ccfrp).
Data for a typical surplus-production model comes in the form of an index
of abundance through time which is assumed to be proportional to the reproducing
biomass for the modeled population that is vulnerable to fishing. The index
is often observed alongside a variety of other known quantities, but at a
minimum, each index will be observed in the presence of some known catch for
the period. Figure (\ref{hakeData}) shows the classic Namibian Hake data set
\cite{punt_model_1988, hilborn_ecological_1997, mangel_theoretical_2006}
exemplifying the form.

Biomass is assumed to evolve as an ODE through time.

%{\color{red}$C=FB$ to set up yield calculations later
Here biomass is assumed to change in time by two processes, net production of
biomass into the population, $P(B)$, and various sources of biomass removal, 
$Z$, \mbox{from the population.}
%Generally production appears as a nonlinear function of existing biomass, 
%and removals are assumed to be linear in biomass.

in this setting is defined as the net biomass increase due to all reproduction
and growth processes.

%sources of mortality other than the recorded fishing from humans. 
The production function is assumed to be a parametric (generally non-linear) 
function relating the current biomass of the population to an aggregate 
production of biomass.

%
Secondly, the population decreases as biomass is removed by various sources 
that are assumed to remove biomass linearly with biomass. Above, $Z(t)$, is 
an aggregate rate of removal. Often the fishing rate, $F(t)$, is the only 
explicitly modeled source of removal $Z(t)=F(t)$, however some models will 
also included other linear terms in $Z(t)$. Commonly the rate of {\it natural 
mortality} ($M$) is also included as an additional term so that $Z(t)=M+F(t)$.

%
%(although in the Chapter (\ref{delayChapter}) a related extension 
%delay differential model is )

%{\color{blue}
%
The general structure in Eq. (\ref{ode}) is the conceptual basis for most 
modern fisheries models used in management \cite{hilborn_quantitative_1992, methot_stock_2013, winker_jabba_2018}. 
As data permit this general structure is often expanded to model age, weight, 
and/or length classes \cite{schnute_general_1987, fournier_length-based_1987} 
in the population via models called {\it age structured models} (ASM). ASMs 
are currently considered best practice when there is %in ``data-rich'' settings when there is 
considered enough quality data to establish length/age relationships and 
%the associated selectivity for these classes 
the vulnerability of each class to fishing mortality (i.e. selectivity)
\cite{maunder_review_2013, cope_stock_2023}. 
Modeling age and length/weight structure in the population allows for 
individual growth and lagged maturity to be modeled as cohorts that age through time. 
Despite this added complexity, at their core ASMs rely on similar dynamics as 
seen in Eq. (\ref{ode}), however in ASMs the above ODE is expanded to a system 
of interrelated equations describing how cohorts age through time. %for each age class.  

%
{\it Delay-differential models} (DDM), as described in more detail in Chapter (\ref{delayChapter}), 
can provide an intermediate modeling infrastructure between SPMs and ASMs. By 
simplifying the model assumptions around growth and maturity, simple ASMs may 
be represented exactly by DDMs \cite{deriso_harvesting_1980, hilborn_quantitative_1992}. 
Furthermore, SPMs can be represented as a limiting case of DDM growth and 
maturity parameters \cite{walters_continuous_2020}. This makes DDMs ideal for ``data-limited'' assessment 
settings and as a simplified model for understanding the role of growth in 
stock assessment models. Despite the useful bridge that DDMs provide, their use in stock 
assessments has been sparing due to the complexity of deriving key management 
quantities under these models \cite{dick_depletion-based_2011, munyandorero_analytical_2023}.%Often the complexdue to a lack of methods . 
%Although analytical results about these models 
%have been sparing \cite{dick_depletion-based_2011, munyandorero_analytical_2023}, RP calculations  

%The simplifying assumptions of DDMs also makes them substantially more 
%computationally efficient that ASMs. These factors make the DDM a perfect 
%bridge for extending the ana

%%
%Secondly, the population decreases as biomass is removed due to catch, $C(t)$.
%While catches (aka yields) are observable quantities \shortcite{pearson_documentation_1997}, %sen_sampling_1984,  
%the model assumes that catch is proportional to biomass with the
%proportionality constant representing the fishing rate, $F(t)$, so that $C(t)=F(t)B(t)$.
From a management perspective a major goal of modeling is to accurately infer
a quantity known as \emph{maximum sustainable yield} (MSY). One could maximize
simple yield at a particular moment in time (and only for that moment) by
fishing all available biomass in that moment. This strategy is penny-wise but
pound-foolish (not to mention ecologically devastating) since it doesn't leave
biomass in the population to reproduce in the future. We seek to fish in a way
that allows (or even encourages) future productivity in the population. This is
accomplished by maximizing the equilibrium level of catch over time.
Equilibrium yield is modeled by $\bar Y = F\bar B(F)$, where $\bar B$ is the 
steady state biomass implied by Eq. (\ref{ode}), and $\bar~$ indicates quantities 
at steady state. 
%in the assumed form for catch, so that $\bar Y = F\bar B(F)$, where $\bar~$
%indicates a value at steady state.
%The steady state biomass is a function of $F$.
%; we will see a specific example of this in
%\mbox{Section (\ref{ptRef}).} 
MSY is then found by maximizing $\bar Y(F)$ with respect to $F$, and $F^*$ is 
the fishing rate at MSY. Going forward let $^*$ decorate any value derived 
under the condition of MSY.

%While a number of different RPs exist which describe the population in different

Most RPs revolve around the concept of MSY (or robust ways of measuring MSY \cite{hilborn_pretty_2010,punt_management_2016}).

Here $F^*$ is the afore mentioned fishing rate which results in MSY, $M$ is natural mortality, 
$\bar B(0)$ is the equilibrium biomass in the absence of fishing, and $B^*$ is 
the equilibrium biomass when fishing at $F^*$ (i.e. $\bar B(F^*)$). 
%$\frac{B^*}{\bar B(0)}$ %is the depletion of the stock at MSY. %That is to say 
Thus, $\frac{F^*}{M}$ describes the fraction of mortality due to fishing when 
the population is expected to yield MSY and $\frac{B^*}{\bar B(0)}$ describes 
the fraction of the unfished population that will remain at MSY.

Many of the most commonly used production functions depend only
on two-parameters. For example, the Schaefer model %{(\color{red}cite)}
depends only on the biological parameters $r$ and $K$, and limits RP inference
so that under the Schaefer model $\left(F^*, \frac{B^*}{\bar B(0)}\right)\in \left(\mathbb{R}^+, \frac{1}{2}\right)$.
The two-parameter Fox model \cite{fox_jr_exponential_1970} limits $\left(F^*, \frac{B^*}{\bar B(0)}\right)\in \left(\mathbb{R}^+, \frac{1}{e}\right)$.
Similarly the two-parameter Cushing \cite{cushing_dependence_1971, cushing_dependence_1973}, Beverton-Holt \cite[BH]{beverton_dynamics_1957}
and Ricker \cite{ricker_stock_1954} production functions do not model the full theoretical space of
RPs. Mangel et. al. \cite{mangel_perspective_2013} show that this is a 
consequence of two-parameter production functions and suggests the use of  
three-parameter functions instead.

By fitting the Namibian Hake data from Figure (\ref{hakeData}) with a 
two-parameter Schaefer model, as compared with a three-parameter PT model, 
the restrictive RP estimation under two-parameter models can be seen.
As will be developed further in Section (\ref{ptRef}), both models can be 
reparameterized directly in terms of their RPs, allowing for straight-forward RP inference.

The bias-variance trade-off \cite{ramasubramanian_machine_2017} makes it

This thesis develops a metamodeling simulation framework for evaluating RP estimation 
under misspecified two-parameter models of productivity. By developing three-parameter 
models in the SPM and DDM settings, analytical and numerical methods are provided for 
generating data broadly in RP space under the Schnute and PT models. A GP metamodel is 
presented for explicit analysis of RP biases under two-parameter models. The analytical 
methods for navigating the relationship between three-parameter models and RPs form the 
foundation of a paper under review based on the work presented in Appendix (\ref{proxyMath}). 
The implementation and analytical results for the DDM is particularly novel and 
contributes to further expansion of the use of DDM models in data-limited stock assessment. 
Additionally involvement in these projects have lead to my contributions in recent stock 
assessments\cite{dick_stock_2023}.

%
The simulation setting under the PT/Schaefer models in Chapter (\ref{ptChapter}) 
demonstrates a simplified and fully analytical setting for developing the 
conceptual basis of how two-parameter productivity models may bias RP estimation. 
A useful notion of contrast is developed here, and the simplified geometry of the 
Schaefer model aids in understanding mechanisms by which a lack of contrast 
contributes to RP biases.

%
Chapter (\ref{schnuteChapter}) generalizes the simulation framework to handle 
SPMs where $F^*$ is not analytical by extending the LHD methods to generate data 
under the Schnute production function. Furthermore, due to the relatively more 
complicated RP response surface induced by the BH geometry an adaptive method of 
augmenting the simulation design is developed for refining hard to resolve features. 
The metamodel analysis of RP estimation under the BH model generalizes the RP 
mapping developed under the Schaefer model to more complex RP sets. Under the 
BH model RP inference demonstrates an approximately shortest distance mapping 
onto the constrained RP space as mediated by the information content provided 
by the available contrast in the data. For the BH RP geometry (unlike the Schaefer model) 
this shortest distance mapping ensures that if there is bias in one of $\frac{B^*}{B_0}$ or 
$\frac{F^*}{M}$, there will necessarily be bias in the other RP. These biases 
would tend to result in potentially overly cautious management for stocks that 
are more density dependent than the BH model, but leads to overestimation of $\frac{F^*}{M}$ for %some the most 
stocks that are less density dependent than the BH model. %(potentially hazardousvulnerable stocks. 
Furthermore, the low contrast simulation setting demonstrates that heavily 
misspecified BH models demonstrate a catastrophic failure mode that

The development of the DDM in Chapter (\ref{delayChapter}) further 
extends the simulation-based analysis of RPs to account for the effects of 
individual growth and lagged maturity/selectivity dynamics. While $F^*$ is not analytical 
under the general Schnute DDM, many of the special cases of the Schnute model 
do provide analytical RP calculations for the DDM.

The effects of individual growth and maturity on RPs are found to be small 
relative to the form of recruitment, but differ by the level of density 
dependence. The behavior of BH RP estimation in the DDM setting is generally 
very similar to the SPM setting. The relationship between the form of recruitment 
and individual growth interact under the BH model to make RP estimation more 
brittle for slower growing stocks. This indicates that better, and/or more flexible, 
models of recruitment may be required to develop more complex DDMs as useful 
and practical models in stock assessment.

\section{Future Work}

%the most complete picture of how RPs are estimated yet
While the work presented here provides a novel understanding of how RPs are 
biased by two parameter models of productivity, there are always improvements 
that can be made in future study. There are two major directions for 
interrelated future work. Firstly, there is always a desire to study additional 
biology dynamics. Secondly, the results presented here suggest that studying 
these more complex biologies would be aided by extensions to the metamodeling 
techniques.

%Biology
%\item Additional Biology Dynamics:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Given the role of contrast: improved notions of understanding/quantifying contrast (such as...)

%	\end{itemize}

%
Given the role of contrast for informing productivity parameters, and thus RPs, 
improved notions of understanding contrast could improve this analysis. This 
analysis develops some mechanisms by which the lack of contrast fails to 
inform RPs, but developing a deeper understanding of how contrast informs 
parameters, or at least developing methods of quantifying observed contrast, 
more generally is clearly important for contextualizing model fit. The notion 
of contrast developed in Section (\ref{catch}) is representative of many 
California fisheries and is useful for the simulation purposes here, but 
methods of understanding the notion more generally would be extremely valuable.  
%The notion of contrast developed in Section (\ref{catch}) if useful and representative of many California fisheries.

%{\color{blue}
%SOME DISCUSSION abotub fixed q.

%The low contrast settings described through-out describe an extremely poorly 
%informated inference setting, and as a result contributes to the weak identifiably

%By 

%
The catchability parameter, $q$, is fixed throughout this work due to the weak 
identifiability between $q$ and $K$ (or $\beta$ as the case may be). As described in Section (\ref{modelFit}), 
this issue arises when estimating both quantities in low contrast simulations. %, as described in Section (\ref{modelFit}). 
This work explores the lower extent of contrast by fixing $q$ to focus 
on the estimation properties of $\theta$, and therefore RPs, in 
the weakest information settings. That said, many stock assessments enjoy more 
informative data than the minimal contrast setting simulated here, and often $q$ 
is not known. By tuning $\chi$ to the lowest value that allows identification of 
$q$ over the range of simulated RPs, one may extend this 
work to estimate $q$, albeit over a smaller range of contrast. 
This is a natural direction for future work and would also contribute to 
developing a more specific understanding of the role of contrast in fisheries 
models.

%
While the DDM developed in Chapter (\ref{delayChapter}) parsimoniously develops 
the most foundational biological processes in fisheries management, further 
developing RP analyses that account for additional biological processes are 
always desired. The addition of recruitment deviations to the DDM is clear a next 
step. Thorson et. al. \cite{thorson_case_2019} show that modeling recruitment deviations
as a random effect composed with BH recruitment can reduce bias in estimates of depletion 
and improve uncertainty quantification for data-limited models of Pacific hake. %such the DDM developed here.
The methods presented in this thesis are an ideal framework for understanding those 
results more broadly in terms of RP model misspecification. 
Furthermore, the simulation framework developed here provides a straightforward 
path for extending into the analysis of more complex ASMs such as Stock 
Synthesis \cite{methot_stock_2013} or FIMS \cite{stawitz_fisheries_2023}.
%Furthermore, expanding this study to incorporate age/length data and various models of selectivity 
%via more complex ASMs such as Stock Synthesis \cite{methot_stock_2013} or FIMS \cite{stawitz_fisheries_2023}

in the SPM and DDM settings presented. That said, several improvements may be made to the metamodeling 
simulation framework itself to facilitate this analysis in more complex settings. Improving the speed 
of simulations would allow for more easily relaxing the simulation assumptions around estimating $q$ and 
increasing the simulated values of residual variation.
Decreasing simulation run time to the order of days in more complex settings would allow the analysis to
%from the order of a week to the order of days would allow the analysis to to tackle more complex models and 
condition on specific stock assessment models and data (i.e. catches, ages, lengths) to consider how RP model 
misspecification may manifest in a given stock assessment. It was not considered a priority 
for the work presented in this thesis but by more effectively refining the simulation design through the 
use of more pointed acquisition functions\cite{pourmohamad_bayesian_2021}, fewer simulations may be collected 
\footnote{The primary factor for determining the run time of these simulations}. In particular, since 
optimization is not a goal of the metamodel in this setting, developing entropy-based acquisition functions 
\cite{hennig_entropy_2012, hernandez-lobato_predictive_2014} could be useful here.

Furthermore, given the 
catastrophic model failure that was observed under low contrast BH models, particularly in the slower 
growing examples, it could be valuable to consider nonstationary GP metamodels \cite{gramacy_bayesian_2008, binois_hetgp_2021, heinonen_non-stationary_2016}. 
These metamodels will come with much more complexity and expense on the metamodeling side of this 
framework, but for the analysis of more computationally expensive stock assessments these costs may be outweighed 
by a more efficient identification of catastrophic failure modes.

%By considering nonstationary metamodels these catastrophic failure modes

%Results presented here generally agree with what is known about estimating population
%productivity parameters \cite{lee_can_2012, conn_when_2010, magnusson_what_2007}.
%Previous studies appreciate the role of contrast for estimating productivity,
%however they struggle to make generally extensible conclusions since they focus only
%on a handful of stocks that fall short of forming a random sample of the greater
%population of possible stock behaviors. The LHD methods presented in Chapters (\ref{ptChapter}) 
%and (\ref{schnuteChapter}) are designed specifically to simulate a representative sample of stocks broadly
%across the space of possible RPs. Furthermore, the simulation design, taken together
%with the GP metamodel of RP estimates, allows this study to control
%the degree of model misspecification and generalize conclusions about the behavior

%In the presence of contrast, $F^*$ estimation can enjoy very low bias even

%This pattern is particularly true for low-contrast inference under the Schaefer model where the

%In all of the cases presented here when model misspecification is removed, even 
%with weakly informative data, RP estimation is unbiased and well estimated. 
%Thus contrast alone is not the only factor leading to inferential failure. 
%Model misspecification is a necessary but not sufficient condition for inducing 
%RP estimation bias. The particular RP bias present depends on the RP geometry 
%of the fitted model and how that geometry is misspecified relative to the data. 
%The RP mapping is then oriented to the RP geometry of the fitted model.

%%SPECULATE ABOUT IDEALLY INFORMATION CATCH PATTERNS (DYNAMIC CALIBRATION OF $F^*$)
%While the relative fishing rate parameterized in Section (\ref{catch}) captures a usefully
%broad spectrum of relevant fishing behaviors, it is still limiting in the amount of information
%that it can induce. Improved methods for quantifying contrast in fisheries data, and/or methods of
%discovering more informative fishing behavior, could improve this analysis. In the absence of a %Without knowing a 
%maximally informative data set simulation methods will not fully describe how
%inference fails, but the methods presented here tell the most complete picture
%yet, with explicit control of the degree model misspecification, contrast, and
%a simulation design that allows for uniform representative data generation
%across biologically meaningful stocks. The results presented here suggest the
%conjecture that under a maximally informative data set, RP inference with a two
%parameter production function will be biased in the direction of a shortest 
%distance map from the true RPs onto restricted set of RPs under the two-parameter 
%model.
%
%%
%Given the potential for model misspecification of RPs, a minimal distance
%mapping of RPs represents a best-case scenario where the total bias of RPs,
%when measured jointly, is minimized. That said, without recognizing the
%geometry of how two-parameter models of productivity limit RP space this may
%lead to unintuitive implications in RP estimation. For example, due to the
%shape of the BH RP set a minimal distance mapping ensures that if there is
%model misspecification with respect to one of $\frac{B^*}{B_0}$ or $F^*$, 
%this will necessarily induce bias in the other RP. However under the 
%Schaefer model, since the RP set is a constant in $\frac{B^*}{B_0}$, 
%estimates of $F^*$ are not contaminated in the
%%bias in $F^*$ is not adulterated in the
%same way by model misspecification of $\frac{B^*}{B_0}$. While models with
%constant RPs, such as the logistic model $\frac{B^*}{B_0}=\frac{1}{2}$,
%the Fox model $\frac{B^*}{B_0}=\frac{1}{e}$, or any PT model with fixed $\gamma$ 
%are extremely limited, they can be valuable tools for developing intuition 
%precisely because they isolate RP estimation in their free RPs as compared 
%with the correlated RP biases present in models like the BH or Ricker model.
%
%%
%When one considers the implications of RP bias, overestimation of RPs carries
%the severe implication of management recommendations potentially leading to
%overfishing, while underestimation of RP leads to overly conservative management.
%In this sense, when the true model is not known, the geometry of the BH set together
%with the metamodeled bias trends makes the BH model a naturally conservative
%estimator of RPs for most stocks. For most non-BH populations the results presented 
%here suggest that the BH model is likely to make conservative errors in its 
%estimates of $F^*$ and $\frac{B^*}{B_0}$. The one notable exception 
%%to the conservatism of the BH model 
%stands for data generated in the Cushing-like regime of Schnute RPs. In this regime 
%the BH model tends to be fairly unbiased overall, however the bias that is present
%for these populations tends to be overestimation in both RPs, which could lead to 
%unintentionally overfishing these already fragile populations.
%{\color{red} nonstationarity in populations may move the true RPs of existing populations into these more vulnerable areas. by sticking to a BH model we will have a hard time understanding those changes as they occur. and a more flexible model would be flexible in noticing those changes.}  
%%much more severe management consequences for those populations.

%%
%The RP bias trends of the Schaefer model demonstrate a much more risk prone RP 
%modeling strategy than the BH overall. %less conservative RP modeling strategy %than the BH overall.
%%{\color{red}conservatism} than the BH overall.
%For any population with $\frac{B^*}{B_0}<0.5$, the results presented here suggest that 
%$\frac{B^*}{B_0}$ will tend to be overestimated. When the population comes from 
%the regime where $\frac{B^*}{B_0}>0.5$, the results presented here suggest that 
%$\frac{B^*}{B_0}$ will tend to be underestimated, but $F^*$ is likely to be 
%overestimated depending on the degree of contrast present in the data. So while 
%the Schaefer model is an intuitive model, it may tends to lead to less conservative 
%RP estimation.

%While it is important to recognize these limitations of two-parameter models

%rational of choosing a BH model of productivity. %Ultimately accuracy of RP estimation,

%Increasing the flexibility of the production function by moving toward
%three-parameter models would release the underlying structural limitations
