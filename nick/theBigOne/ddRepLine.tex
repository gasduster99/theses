The replacement line is the rate of productivity which exactly balances
biomass loss in the absence of fishing. In the simple production model, %productivity of the popuplation. 
productivity must simply balance biomass loss due to $M$. Thus when
$R(B;\theta)>MB$ there will be some surplus productivity to enable
fishing.

%
In the delay model, productivity is complicated by biomass changing, both
with the recruitment of young into the reproducing population, as well as
biomass accumulation due to the growth of existing individuals in the
population. To derive the replacement line in the case of the delay model
the equilibrium equations in the absence of fishing are considered and
the $R(B)$ that this implies is then isolated.
%
\begin{align}
&0=\frac{dB}{dt} = w(a_s)R(B) + \kappa \left[w_\infty N-B\right] - MB \label{bBar}\\
&0=\frac{dN}{dt} = R(B) - MN. \label{nBar}
\end{align}
%
Eq(\ref{nBar}) quickly gives $\bar{N} = R(B)/M$. Substituting this equilibrium
value into Eq(\ref{bBar}) to rewrite $N$ in terms of $B$,
%At equilibrium 
%$\frac{dB}{dt}=\frac{dN}{dt}=0$, and thus %moving forward  equationsSince both equations are in equilibriu
%\begin{align}
%w(a_s)R(B) + \kappa \left[w_\infty N-B\right] - MB = R(B) - MN.
%\end{align}
%
%Making use of the equlibrium value $\bar{N} = R(B)/M$ to rewrite $N$ in terms of $B$, %and collecting like
\begin{align}
0 = w(a_s)R(B) + \kappa \left[w_\infty \frac{R(B)}{M}-B\right] - MB. %R(B) - M \frac{R(B)}{M}.
\end{align}
Collecting like terms,
\begin{align}
R(B)\left[w(a_s)+\frac{\kappa w_\infty}{M}\right] = \left[M+\kappa\right]B. %
\end{align}
Finally solving for $R(B)$, and simplifying, gives the equation of the replacement line as,
\begin{align}
R(B) = \left[\frac{M(M+\kappa)}{w(a_s)M+\kappa w_\infty}\right]B. %
\end{align}
