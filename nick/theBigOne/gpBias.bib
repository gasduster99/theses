	abstract = {A form for the growth term in the differential equation for biomass change with time is proposed, which is based on a versatile new family of stock-recruitment curves. The resultant yield curves of a general production model are investigated. The form of the curves is more variable than is usual in such models, but depends systematically on the values adopted for biologically well-defined parameters such as natural mortality and natural rate of increase. The consequences for management are explored by examining the magnitude of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and suitable values for the yield⧸biomass ratio. It is concluded that the MSY is of the order of but usually somewhat less than 0.5 MB0, although variation by a factor of three either way is possible. MSY is usually attained at a yield⧸biomass ratio no more than a few times M (the natural mortality), and at biomasses less than half the pristine biomass (B0). However, exploitation of stocks having domed stock-recruitment curves at MSY is dangerous, because the ability of the population to recover from perturbations is impaired. This is associated with an increase in the return time for the population.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the biomass of reproductively mature individuals (spawning stock) and the resulting offspring added to the population (recruitment), the stock–recruitment relationship, is a fundamental and challenging problem in all of population biology. The steepness of this relationship is commonly defined as the fraction of recruitment from an unfished population obtained when the spawning stock biomass is 20\% of its unfished level. Since its introduction about 20 years ago, steepness has become widely used in fishery management, where it is usually treated as a statistical quantity. Here, we investigate the reproductive ecology of steepness, using both unstructured and age-structured models. We show that if one has sufficient information to construct a density-independent population model (maximum per capita productivity and natural mortality for the unstructured case or maximum per capita productivity, natural mortality and schedules of size and maturity at age for the structured model) then one can construct a point estimate for steepness. Thus, steepness cannot be chosen arbitrarily. If one assumes that the survival of recruited individuals fluctuates within populations, it is possible, by considering the early life history, to construct a prior distribution for steepness from this same demographic information. We develop the ideas for both compensatory (Beverton–Holt) and over-compensatory (Ricker) stock–recruitment relationships. We illustrate our ideas with an example concerning bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus/orientalis, Scombridae). We show that assuming that steepness is unity when recruitment is considered to be environmentally driven is not biologically consistent, is inconsistent with a precautionary approach, and leads to the wrong scientific inference (which also applies for assigning steepness any other single value).},

The derivations lead to a re-parameterization of the common stock – recruit relationships, Beverton– Holt and Ricker, in terms of spawning potential ratio. Often, parameters in stock–recruit relationships are restricted by tight prior distributions or are ﬁxed based on a hypothesized level of stock resilience. Fixing those parameters is equivalent to specifying the biological reference points. An ability to directly calculate reference points from biological data, or a meta-analysis, without need of a full assessment model or ﬁsheries data, makes the method an attractive option for data-poor ﬁsheries. The derivations reveal an explicit link between the biological characteristics of a species and appropriate management.

The Ecological Detective makes liberal use of computer programming for the generation of hypotheses, exploration of data, and the comparison of different models. The authors' attitude is one of exploration, both statistical and graphical. The background required is minimal, so that students with an undergraduate course in statistics and ecology can profitably add this work to their tool-kit for solving ecological problems.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can ﬂexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate ﬁshery management quantities such as ﬁshing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model conﬁgurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efﬁciently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

	abstract = {Stock assessments based on the integrated paradigm often include an underlying stock-recruitment relationship. This, along with estimates of fishery selectivity and biological parameters, allows the biomass and fishing mortality associated with Maximum Sustainable Yield (BMSY and FMSY respectively) to be calculated. However, the estimates of these quantities may differ from the proxies assumed in the harvest control rules that are used to provide management advice. Moreover, the estimated values for BMSY and FMSY are related functionally in population dynamics models based on 2-parameter stock-recruitment relationships such as the commonly used Beverton-Holt or Ricker relationships. Use of 2-parameter stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs) consequently restricts the ability to fully quantify the uncertainty associated with estimating BMSY and FMSY because 2-parameter SRRs restrict the potential range of values for BMSY/B0. In principle, BMSY/B0 and FMSY can be more independent if the stock-recruitment relationship is more general than these 2-parameter SRRs. This paper outlines eleven potential 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationships and evaluates them in terms of whether they are able to match a wide range of specifications for BMSY (expressed relative to unfished spawning stock biomass, B0) and FMSY (expressed relative to natural mortality, M). Of the eleven 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationships considered, the Ricker-Power stock-recruitment relationship is found to best satisfy the characteristics of (a) being able to mimic a wide range of BMSY/B0 and FMSY/M values, (b) not to lead to negative recruitment for biomasses between 0 and B0, and (c) not to lead to increasing recruitment while approaching the limit of zero population size. Bayesian assessments of three example groundfish species off the US west coast (aurora rockfish, petrale sole, and cabezon) are conducted using Simple Stock Synthesis based on the Beverton-Holt and Ricker-Power stock-recruitment relationships to illustrate some of the impacts of allowing for a 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationship.},

We use both production and age-structured models to explore these patterns. For the production model, we derive explicit relationships for steepness and life history parameters and then for steepness and major reference points. For the age-structured model, we are required to generally use numerical computation, and so we provide an example that complements the analytical results of the production model. We discuss what it means to set steepness equal to 1 and how to construct a prior for steepness. Ways out of the difficult situation raised by fixing steepness and life history parameters include not fixing them, using a more complicated stock–recruitment relationship, and being more explicit about the information content of the data and what that means for policy makers. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach.},

We describe two spatial applications for which Gaussian distributional assumptions are clearly inappropriate. The first concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Pacific island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a conventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity. The second application provides a description of spatial variation in the risk of campylobacter infections relative to other enteric infections in part of north Lancashire and south Cumbria. For this application, we treat the data as binomial counts at unit postcode locations, conditionally on an unobserved relative risk surface which we estimate. The theoretical framework for our extension of geostatistical methods is that, conditionally on the unobserved process S(x), observations at sample locations xi form a generalized linear model with the corresponding values of S(xi) appearing as an offset term in the linear predictor. We use a Bayesian inferential framework, implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, to solve the prediction problem for non-linear functionals of S(x), making a proper allowance for the uncertainty in the estimation of any model parameters.},

MSE can be used to identify a ‘best’ management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice’ guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

At low but still workable levels of resiliency, the F 40\% strategy results in undesirably low levels of biomass and recruitment by present-day standards. That can be cured by adopting a higher target for spawning biomass per recruit, though at some cost in yield. A purely biomass-based strategy and a modified F MSY strategy are discussed as alternatives for cases where adequate historical data are available.},

	abstract = {The nature and intensity of intraspecific competition can vary greatly among taxa, yet similarities in these interactions can lead to similar population dynamics among related organisms. Variation along the spectrum of intraspecific competition, with contest and scramble competition as endpoints, leads to vastly different responses to population density. Here we investigated the diversity of intraspecific competition among fish species, predicting that functional forms of density-d­ ependent reproduction would be conserved in related taxa. Using a hierarchical model that links stock–recruitment parameters among populations, species, and orders, we found that the strength of overcompensation, and therefore the type of intraspecific competition, is tightly clustered within taxonomic groupings, as species within an order share similar degrees of compensation. Specifically, species within the orders Salmoniformes and Pleuronectiformes exhibited density dependence ­indicative of scramble competition (overcompensation) while the orders Clupeiformes, ­Gadiformes, Perciformes, and Scorpaeniformes exhibited dynamics consistent with contest competition (compensation). Maximum potential recruitment also varied among orders, but with less clustering across species. We also tested whether stock–recruitment parameters correlated with maximum body length among species, but found no strong relationship. Our results suggest that much of the variation in the form of density-d­ependent reproduction among fish species may be predicted taxonomically due to evolved life history traits and reproductive behaviors.},

This paper describes the R package GA, a collection of general purpose functions that provide a flexible set of tools for applying a wide range of genetic algorithm methods. Several examples are discussed, ranging from mathematical functions in one and two dimensions known to be hard to optimize with standard derivative-based methods, to some selected statistical problems which require the optimization of user defined objective functions.

	abstract = {In this work we present a novel surplus production model for fisheries stock assessment. Our goal is to enhance parameter estimation and fitting speed. The model employs a production function that differs from the canonical logistic (Schaefer) and Gompertz (Fox) functions, but is still connected to the Pella–Tomlinson formulation. We embed this function in a state-space model, using observed catch-per-unit-effort indices and measures of fishing effort as input. From the literature we derive Bayesian prior densities for all model hyperparameters (carrying capacity, catchability, growth rate and error variance), as well as the state (annual stock biomass). We use the well-studied Namibian hake fishery as a case study, via which we compare the Schaefer, Fox and Pella–Tomlinson models with the new model. We also develop a package for the software R, which employs a Shiny application for data exploration, model specification, and output analyses. Posterior densities of hyperparameters and reference points agree across models. Identifiability issues emerge in the more cumbersome Pella–Tomlinson model. The new model yields small but consistent improvements in precision. It also renders implementation faster and easier, with no hidden truncation of negative biomasses. We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical extensions to this new model.},

The method works by sampling points from the parameter space using an experimental design and then fitting a kriging model to interpolate the unnormalized posterior. The approximated posterior density is a weighted average of normal densities, and therefore, most of the posterior quantities can be easily computed. DoIt is a general computing technique that is easy to implement and can be applied to many complex Bayesian problems. Moreover, it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality as much as some quadrature methods. It can work using fewer posterior evaluations, which is a great advantage over the Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, especially when dealing with computationally expensive posteriors.

	abstract = {In this paper we present the R package deSolve to solve initial value problems (IVP) written as ordinary differential equations (ODE), differential algebraic equations (DAE) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations (PDE), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the ODEPACK package (LSODE, LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR), DVODE and DASPK2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e.g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the benefits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R’s high-level procedures. deSolve is the successor of package odesolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

	abstract = {Models of stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs) are often used to predict fish population dynamics. Commonly used SRRs include the Ricker, Beverton-Holt, and Cushing functional forms, which differ primarily by the degree of density-dependent effects (compensation). The degree of compensation determines whether recruitment respectively decreases, saturates, or increases at high levels of spawning stock biomass. In 1982, J.G. Shepherd united these dynamics into a single model, where the degree of compensation is determined by a single parameter. However, the difficulty in relating this parameter to biological data has limited its usefulness. Here, we use a generalized modeling framework to show that the degree of compensation can be related directly to the functional elasticity of growth, which is a general quantity that measures the change in recruitment relative to a change in biomass. We show that the elasticity of growth can be calculated from perturbations in fish biomass, is robust to observation error, and can be used to determine general attributes of the SRR in both continuous time production models, as well as discrete time age-structured models.},

It was found that the index of density dependence was inversely correlated with the cube root of the fecundity, which implies that for stocks of the same size, the distance apart of the larvae plays animportant part in the determination of density dependence.Four pelagic stocks, Hokkaido herring, Norwegian herring, Japanese sardine and Californian sardine, were examined.

	abstract = {Our tasks in performing stock assessment are to estimate what is in the population now, what is likely to be there in the near-future, and how we should best extract yield without imperiling future reproduction or yield. There are many considerations for modeling recruitment in a stock assessment, and I walk through the typical sequence of decisions an analyst must make when setting up their stock assessment. I begin with the deceptively simple decision of the first modeled age, progress through the treatment of fecundity, and into the important decision of parameterizing the stock recruit relationship (SRR). Subsequent assessment steps such as projections and estimation of reference points build on these earlier decisions. The consequences of many of these decisions are amplified or obviated, depending on whether or not a null SRR model (mean or median with deviations) is implemented. Examples of expanding or attenuating consequences are provided within each decision. The potential for misspecification related to these decisions is noted, and advice to reduce that misspecification as well as suggested diagnostics are offered. As a high level summary, I recommend fitting the null SRR, using weight as a surrogate for fecundity and conducting sensitivity analysis if there are data suggesting significant departure from isometry. If estimating a non-null SRR, move away from the steepness parameterization (return to the original α,β parameterization), and do not begin at age 0. Lastly, exercise caution when incorporating covariates –they may be hitchhikers posing as drivers.},

	abstract = {This paper is devoted to develop some “ad hoc” Control Theory formalism useful for the famous Beverton–Holt equation arising in population dynamics. In particular, the inverse equation is redefined for a finite set of consecutive samples under the equivalent form of a discrete linear dynamic system whose input sequence is defined by the sequence of carrying capacity gains and the unforced dynamics is directly related to the intrinsic growth rate. For that purpose, the environment carrying capacity gains are allowed to be time-varying and designed for control purposes. The controllability property is also investigated on this dynamic extended system as well as the stability, equilibrium points and attractor oscillating trajectories. The properties of the dynamic system associated with the Beverton–Holt inverse equation allow extrapolate in a simple dual way the above properties to the standard Beverton–Holt equation. Some generalizations are given for the case when there are extra parameters in the equation or when the system is subject to the presence of additive disturbances. In all cases, a reference model being also of Beverton–Holt type is proposed to be followed by the control system.},

	abstract = {When viewed on a discrete time step (e.g., one year) rather than instantaneously, the Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock recruitment relationships describe a strong influence of changes in adult abundance on juvenile survival even at low biomass levels. In fact, they describe a stronger influence at lower adult abundance than at high adult abundance. This is not consistent with a simplistic interpretation of carrying capacity, where survival reduces more rapidly as the juvenile abundance approaches its carrying capacity due to resource limitation. It implies that other processes (e.g., changes in predation risk with increased abundance as described by arena theory) control density dependence. A simple habitat limitation model suggests that a similar relationship can occur if the number of juveniles produced by the adults is always more than the juvenile carrying capacity. However, the resulting stock-recruitment relationship is constant recruitment, while that of the Beverton-Holt is increasing asymptotically and the Ricker is dome shaped. Fluctuations around an average recruitment level for a wide range of adult abundance levels is common for highly fecund pelagic spawners (e.g., tuna), suggesting that the survival and recruitment relationships implied by the simple habitat limitation model might be appropriate for these species. Underpinning this argument is the concept that the adult population will saturate the juvenile carrying capacity unless the adult population is fished to extremely low levels. However, it is reasonable to expect that survival should be density independent, or possibly even decompensatory, at some low level of adult abundance. Ignoring depensation, the survival relationship would therefore be well described by a general logistic equation where the decline in survival initially accelerates as abundance increases and then deaccelerates. The resulting stock-recruitment relationship would be a hockey stick shape with the possibility of reduced recruitment at large stock sizes. The model could also be used for low fecund species (e.g., sharks) for which the juvenile carrying capacity is not saturated until the adult abundance is large (i.e., survival is density-independent for a wide range of adult population sizes). In our model, particularly for high fecund species, temporal variation in recruitment would be controlled by changes in the juvenile carrying capacity. We provide equations for the generalized logistic survival stock-recruitment model and investigate the yield consequences. We suggest that an important management consideration is the level of adult abundance at which the juvenile carrying capacity becomes saturated (i.e., when does density dependence become influential on juvenile survival).},

	abstract = {Mathematics plays a major role in contemporary fisheries management. Stock assessments often depend on elaborate models used to set catch levels and address other policy objectives. In recent years, the collapse of various important fish stocks has caused some critics to suggest that mathematical models actually obscure the truth by narrowing scientific understanding to the realm of quantifiable events. In the words of one fisherman, ``Mathematics has highjacked the definition and position of real science.'' In this paper, I present a number of typical fishery models, examine their limitations, discuss controversies about their use, and explore possible alternatives. I draw on examples from economics and investment theory to illustrate the problem of making credible predictions about an uncertain future. The constraints of the real world, where people care deeply about policy consequences, have altered my scientific perspective as an applied mathematician. This paper reflects the evolution of thought that has accompanied my experience working for 28 years at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, B.C., the host city for this conference.},
