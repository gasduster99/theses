	abstract = {Improving the quality of a product/process using a computer simulator is a much less expensive option than the real physical testing. However, simulation using computationally intensive computer models can be time consuming and, therefore, directly doing the optimization on the computer simulator can be infeasible. Experimental design and statistical modeling techniques can be used to overcome this problem. This article reviews experimental designs known as space-filling designs that are suitable for computer simulations. In the article, a special emphasis is given for a recently developed space-filling design called maximum projection design. Its advantages are illustrated using a simulation conducted for optimizing a milling process.},

Equations are derived which are used to solve for the percentage points of the order statistics and a table of the percentage points is given. The problem of the best linear unbiased estimate of the scale parameter of the distribution which is based on order statistics is, briefly, discussed for the censored (type II) case. The modal value of an order statistic is derived and a table of these values is given for the cases of the smallest and the largest order statistics. Applications to life-tests, extreme values, reliability and maintenance are described and illustrated in some cases.},

	abstract = {Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a popular method for evaluating the expectation of functions in computer experiments. However when the expectation of interest is taken with respect to a nonuniform distribution, the usual transformation to the probability space can cause relatively smooth functions to become extremely variable in areas of low probability. Consequently, the equal probability cells inherent in hypercube methods often tend to sample an insufficient proportion of the total points in these areas. This article introduces Latin hyperrectangle sampling (LHRS), a generalization of LHS that allows for nonequal cell probabilities, to address this problem. A number of examples are given illustrating the improvement of the proposed methodology over LHS with respect to the variance of the resulting estimators. Extensions to orthogonal array-based LHS, stratified LHS, and scrambled nets are also described.},

Inference 26 (1990) 131–148) establishes equivalence of the maximin distance design criterion and an entropy criterion motivated by function prediction in a Bayesian setting. The latter criterion has been used by Currin et al. (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 86 (1991) 953–963) to design experiments for which the motivating application is approximation of a complex deterministic computer model. Because computer experiments often have a large number of controlled variables (inputs), maximin designs of moderate size are often concentrated in the corners of the cuboidal design region, i.e. each input is represented at only two levels. Here we will examine some maximin distance designs constructed within the class of Latin hypercube arrangements. The goal of this is to find designs which offer a compromise between the entropy/maximin criterion, and good projective properties in each dimension (as guaranteed by Latin hypercubes). A simulated annealing search algorithm is presented for constructing these designs, and patterns apparent in the optimal designs are discussed.},
