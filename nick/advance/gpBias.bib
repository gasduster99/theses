	abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best’ management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice’ guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

	abstract = {Stock assessments based on the integrated paradigm often include an underlying stock-recruitment relationship. This, along with estimates of fishery selectivity and biological parameters, allows the biomass and fishing mortality associated with Maximum Sustainable Yield (BMSY and FMSY respectively) to be calculated. However, the estimates of these quantities may differ from the proxies assumed in the harvest control rules that are used to provide management advice. Moreover, the estimated values for BMSY and FMSY are related functionally in population dynamics models based on 2-parameter stock-recruitment relationships such as the commonly used Beverton-Holt or Ricker relationships. Use of 2-parameter stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs) consequently restricts the ability to fully quantify the uncertainty associated with estimating BMSY and FMSY because 2-parameter SRRs restrict the potential range of values for BMSY/B0. In principle, BMSY/B0 and FMSY can be more independent if the stock-recruitment relationship is more general than these 2-parameter SRRs. This paper outlines eleven potential 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationships and evaluates them in terms of whether they are able to match a wide range of specifications for BMSY (expressed relative to unfished spawning stock biomass, B0) and FMSY (expressed relative to natural mortality, M). Of the eleven 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationships considered, the Ricker-Power stock-recruitment relationship is found to best satisfy the characteristics of (a) being able to mimic a wide range of BMSY/B0 and FMSY/M values, (b) not to lead to negative recruitment for biomasses between 0 and B0, and (c) not to lead to increasing recruitment while approaching the limit of zero population size. Bayesian assessments of three example groundfish species off the US west coast (aurora rockfish, petrale sole, and cabezon) are conducted using Simple Stock Synthesis based on the Beverton-Holt and Ricker-Power stock-recruitment relationships to illustrate some of the impacts of allowing for a 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationship.},

We first review published data and give new results showing that key reference points are fixed when steepness and other life history parameters are fixed in stock assessments using a Beverton–Holt stock–recruitment relationship. We use both production and age-structured models to explore these patterns. For the production model, we derive explicit relationships for steepness and life history parameters and then for steepness and major reference points. For the age-structured model, we are required to generally use numerical computation, and so we provide an example that complements the analytical results of the production model. We discuss what it means to set steepness equal to 1 and how to construct a prior for steepness. Ways out of the difficult situation raised by fixing steepness and life history parameters include not fixing them, using a more complicated stock–recruitment relationship, and being more explicit about the information content of the data and what that means for policy makers. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach.},

How do we make the field and laboratory coherent? How do we link models and data? How do we use statistics to help experimentation? How do we integrate modeling and statistics? How do we confront multiple hypotheses with data and assign degrees of belief to different hypotheses? How do we deal with time series (in which data are linked from one measurement to the next) or put multiple sources of data into one inferential framework? These are the kinds of questions asked and answered by The Ecological Detective. Ray Hilborn and Marc Mangel investigate ecological data much as a detective would investigate a crime scene by trying different hypotheses until a coherent picture emerges. The book is not a set of pat statistical procedures but rather an approach. The Ecological Detective makes liberal use of computer programming for the generation of hypotheses, exploration of data, and the comparison of different models. The authors' attitude is one of exploration, both statistical and graphical. The background required is minimal, so that students with an undergraduate course in statistics and ecology can profitably add this work to their tool-kit for solving ecological problems.},

This rate can be calculated directly from biological parameters of maturity, fecundity, and natural mortality or a distribution for this rate can be derived from appropriate metadata. Minimal data needs and assumptions for determining stock status are discussed. The derivations lead to a re-parameterization of the common stock – recruit relationships, Beverton– Holt and Ricker, in terms of spawning potential ratio. Often, parameters in stock–recruit relationships are restricted by tight prior distributions or are ﬁxed based on a hypothesized level of stock resilience. Fixing those parameters is equivalent to specifying the biological reference points. An ability to directly calculate reference points from biological data, or a meta-analysis, without need of a full assessment model or ﬁsheries data, makes the method an attractive option for data-poor ﬁsheries. The derivations reveal an explicit link between the biological characteristics of a species and appropriate management. Predicted stock status for a suite of shark species was compared with recent stock assessment results, and the method successfully identiﬁed whether each stock was overﬁshed.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the biomass of reproductively mature individuals (spawning stock) and the resulting offspring added to the population (recruitment), the stock–recruitment relationship, is a fundamental and challenging problem in all of population biology. The steepness of this relationship is commonly defined as the fraction of recruitment from an unfished population obtained when the spawning stock biomass is 20\% of its unfished level. Since its introduction about 20 years ago, steepness has become widely used in fishery management, where it is usually treated as a statistical quantity. Here, we investigate the reproductive ecology of steepness, using both unstructured and age-structured models. We show that if one has sufficient information to construct a density-independent population model (maximum per capita productivity and natural mortality for the unstructured case or maximum per capita productivity, natural mortality and schedules of size and maturity at age for the structured model) then one can construct a point estimate for steepness. Thus, steepness cannot be chosen arbitrarily. If one assumes that the survival of recruited individuals fluctuates within populations, it is possible, by considering the early life history, to construct a prior distribution for steepness from this same demographic information. We develop the ideas for both compensatory (Beverton–Holt) and over-compensatory (Ricker) stock–recruitment relationships. We illustrate our ideas with an example concerning bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus/orientalis, Scombridae). We show that assuming that steepness is unity when recruitment is considered to be environmentally driven is not biologically consistent, is inconsistent with a precautionary approach, and leads to the wrong scientific inference (which also applies for assigning steepness any other single value).},

The form of the curves is more variable than is usual in such models, but depends systematically on the values adopted for biologically well-defined parameters such as natural mortality and natural rate of increase. The consequences for management are explored by examining the magnitude of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and suitable values for the yield⧸biomass ratio. It is concluded that the MSY is of the order of but usually somewhat less than 0.5 MB0, although variation by a factor of three either way is possible. MSY is usually attained at a yield⧸biomass ratio no more than a few times M (the natural mortality), and at biomasses less than half the pristine biomass (B0). However, exploitation of stocks having domed stock-recruitment curves at MSY is dangerous, because the ability of the population to recover from perturbations is impaired. This is associated with an increase in the return time for the population.},

A maximum sustainable yield, predicted by the exponential model, is obtained from a population size which is about 37\% of the environmentally limited maximum size. Three methods for estimating the parameters of the exponential model, adapted from those used for the linear model of Schaefer (1954, 1957), are presented. The exponential model is compared with the linear model using examples of the fisheries for the California sardine, Sardinops caerulea (Girard), and yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares (Bonnaterre) of the eastern tropical Pacific and western Atlantic Oceans. Management implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this work we present a novel surplus production model for fisheries stock assessment. Our goal is to enhance parameter estimation and fitting speed. The model employs a production function that differs from the canonical logistic (Schaefer) and Gompertz (Fox) functions, but is still connected to the Pella–Tomlinson formulation. We embed this function in a state-space model, using observed catch-per-unit-effort indices and measures of fishing effort as input. From the literature we derive Bayesian prior densities for all model hyperparameters (carrying capacity, catchability, growth rate and error variance), as well as the state (annual stock biomass). We use the well-studied Namibian hake fishery as a case study, via which we compare the Schaefer, Fox and Pella–Tomlinson models with the new model. We also develop a package for the software R, which employs a Shiny application for data exploration, model specification, and output analyses. Posterior densities of hyperparameters and reference points agree across models. Identifiability issues emerge in the more cumbersome Pella–Tomlinson model. The new model yields small but consistent improvements in precision. It also renders implementation faster and easier, with no hidden truncation of negative biomasses. We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical extensions to this new model.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the original derivation of the F 35\% (later F 40\%) harvest strategy, which consists of fishing at a rate that reduces spawning biomass per recruit to 35\% (or 40\%) of the unfished value, and investigates its applicability to long-lived stocks with low resiliency, such as some of the Pacific Coast rockfishes Sebastes spp. The life history parameters are unimportant (at least in deterministic calculations), but the possibility of extremely low levels of resiliency—well below the bounds of the original analysis—does render the strategy unworkable in the sense that there is no harvest rate that will obtain a large fraction of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) across the entire range of possibilities. At low but still workable levels of resiliency, the F 40\% strategy results in undesirably low levels of biomass and recruitment by present-day standards. That can be cured by adopting a higher target for spawning biomass per recruit, though at some cost in yield. A purely biomass-based strategy and a modified F MSY strategy are discussed as alternatives for cases where adequate historical data are available.},

	abstract = {The nature and intensity of intraspecific competition can vary greatly among taxa, yet similarities in these interactions can lead to similar population dynamics among related organisms. Variation along the spectrum of intraspecific competition, with contest and scramble competition as endpoints, leads to vastly different responses to population density. Here we investigated the diversity of intraspecific competition among fish species, predicting that functional forms of density-d­ ependent reproduction would be conserved in related taxa. Using a hierarchical model that links stock–recruitment parameters among populations, species, and orders, we found that the strength of overcompensation, and therefore the type of intraspecific competition, is tightly clustered within taxonomic groupings, as species within an order share similar degrees of compensation. Specifically, species within the orders Salmoniformes and Pleuronectiformes exhibited density dependence ­indicative of scramble competition (overcompensation) while the orders Clupeiformes, ­Gadiformes, Perciformes, and Scorpaeniformes exhibited dynamics consistent with contest competition (compensation). Maximum potential recruitment also varied among orders, but with less clustering across species. We also tested whether stock–recruitment parameters correlated with maximum body length among species, but found no strong relationship. Our results suggest that much of the variation in the form of density-d­ependent reproduction among fish species may be predicted taxonomically due to evolved life history traits and reproductive behaviors.},

	abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) are stochastic search algorithms inspired by the basic principles of biological evolution and natural selection. GAs simulate the evolution of living organisms, where the fittest individuals dominate over the weaker ones, by mimicking the biological mechanisms of evolution, such as selection, crossover and mutation. GAs have been successfully applied to solve optimization problems, both for continuous (whether differentiable or not) and discrete functions.

This paper describes the R package GA, a collection of general purpose functions that provide a flexible set of tools for applying a wide range of genetic algorithm methods. Several examples are discussed, ranging from mathematical functions in one and two dimensions known to be hard to optimize with standard derivative-based methods, to some selected statistical problems which require the optimization of user defined objective functions.
