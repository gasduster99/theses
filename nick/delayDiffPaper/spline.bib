	abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of ﬁsh assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can ﬂexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate ﬁshery management quantities such as ﬁshing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model conﬁgurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efﬁciently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},
